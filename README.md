**Executive Summary:**

Base on the hypothesis that data generated by wearable-sensors could be use to find patters of human activity, a practical machine learning alghoritm (PML) was developed, trained, verificated and tested with data generated by four sensors, in order to find patters of human activity (Weight Lifting Exercises) of a subject wearing those sensors. 

The data collected contains 5 different classes of activities, (sitting-down, standing-up, standing, walking, and sitting), and was collected on 8 hours of activities of 4 healthy subjects. The raw data was processed, synchronized, code-labeled `classe`, while the participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter.

After downloading the data sets, a Random Forrest model was developed to reach a ** high Accuracy (0.9937)** and **low error rate (0.6%)**.

The final model was able to correctly classify all 20 cases in the test set.
